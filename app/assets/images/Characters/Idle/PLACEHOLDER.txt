This is a placeholder file. 

To use character sprites, you need to add 15 sprite images for the idle animation in this directory.
The images should be named as follows:

Idle (1).png
Idle (2).png
...
Idle (15).png

These images should be PNG files with transparency and consistent dimensions.
